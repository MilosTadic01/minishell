## Installation

On Linux or Mac OS, open a terminal and execute the following commands.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:MilosTadic01/minishell.git
```

```bash
$ cd minishell
```

```bash
$ make
```

```bash
$ ./minishell
```

After the greeting message, you will notice `minishell>` at the beginning of each prompt rather than `%` or `$`. Try giving minishell a spin. To exit to the parent shell, enter `CTRL + D` on your keyboard.
